#Milestone 3

For Milestone 3, we focused on adding database functionality to three of the web pages, the class information page, session editor page, and the lecture material page. Using firebase to fetch data, we present cape data(csv imported to json) and student data to the user for the class information page. For the session editor page, we gave users the ability to create their own questions for a session and is stored onto firebase after creation. Finally, we added a comment feature for the lecture material page in which students can ask questions about a specific lecture material(comments also stored on firebase)

In terms of front-end, we did light touch ups on the pages mentioned above. We will focus more on the front-end side in the coming weeks.
