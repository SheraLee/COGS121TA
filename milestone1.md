## Proposal 
### Target user
Our target users are profeesors teaching in lager classrooms.Since three of us are all UCSD students, so none of us is in the traget user group.


### Decription of our team's idea 

Due to the large amount of students in the classroom, professors need a better way to keep students' attension, record their attendance, and get student's feedbacks. In order to achieve this we will build a web app that can increase interactions between professors and students during class and help the professors get more timely feedback from students.  

### Possible API 
 
To take attendance, we may use google cloud API to do facial recognision and read GPS locataion. We may also use google classroom API to create classes, distribute assignments, send feedback, and see everything in one place.
