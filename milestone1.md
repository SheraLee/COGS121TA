## Proposal 
### Target user
  Our target users are profeesors teaching in lager classrooms.Since three of us are all UCSD students, so none of us is in the traget user group. 
### Decription of our team's idea 
  Due to the large amount of students in the classroom, professors need a better way to keep students' attension, record their attendance, and get student's feedbacks. In order to achieve this we will build a web app that can increase interactions between professors and students during class and help the professors get more timely feedback from students.
