# Milestone 4

For Milestone 4, we decided to add a collapsible sidebar in order to make it easier for the user to navigate through the site. We also decided to change the color scheme of the site using Navy blue and white for the main colors. Another aesthetic feature we added was shadows to the content on the page to help make it pop up. Finally, we added color coded features for the data in the class statistics page.

In terms of functionality, we added the ability to comment on a specific class material and added a basic question maker for class sessions.
