# Milestone 5

## How target user would use your app in order to help them achieve relevant goals.

Our target users are professors teaching in larger classrooms.

Due to the large amount of students in the classroom, professors need a better way to control the class. Our app can increase interactions between professors and students during class and help professors get more timely feedback from students to improve the class experience without interrupting the lecture. 

1) In our slides page, students can ask questions in class, the professor can adjust his pace based on those quetion and feedbacks. If the instructor do not address a specific problem in class, the TAs can also answer in the comment sections. This ensures that every students will be able to follow the pace of the professor
