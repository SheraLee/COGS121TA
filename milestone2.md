# Milestone 2
Member's Name: Xirui Li, Yanyi Wang, Vincent Alday

We kept our original idea which is to create a web app that can increase interactions between professors and students during class and help professors get more timely feedback from students to improve the class experience. Adding to this idea, we are going to create a class evaluation page(or statistic page) for professors to view their class feedback and evaluations from students in previous class. We are creating this because sometimes professor might not going to look at their evaluations on other websites such as rate my professor, but it is really helpful for them to get more feedback from students in order to redesign class structure or make any improvement. 



### Login page
![Picture1](/milestone_2_pictures/login.png) 
We created a login page, and it is not using ucsd login as prototype 2 designed. It is hard to get UCSD sign in api and we also want the app target to professors from other schools.

### Landing page (Home Page)
![Picture2](/milestone_2_pictures/landing.png) 
This page is where you can select a school/professor/ class to start with. It is same with the prototype 1, since a search box is creating more flexibility for users.

### Search Result page
![Picture3](/milestone_2_pictures/search_result.png)
The search option from the landing page is immediately followed by the search results page which displays a list of schools related to what was put in the search box. The design of this page is the same as prototype 1

### My class page
![Picture4](/milestone_2_pictures/my_classes.png)
This page is showing professor’s classes dashboard. It is the same with prototype 2’s dashboard design. 

### Class page
![Picture5](/milestone_2_pictures/class_page.png)
This page has four sections: start session, edit session, class material and class statistics. It is different from prototype design. It is now more organized and clear for professors to choose which task to do and where to go. It is specifying the core functionality of the app. 

### Active session (start session)
![Picture6](/milestone_2_pictures/session_active.png)
This page has the lecture questions on and class statistics visualized using figures.
It is similar to prototype 1 and contain all functions in the prototype. 

### Class Material Page
![Picture7](/milestone_2_pictures/class_material.png)
This page contains class material distributed by the professor. It can include, lecture slides, syllabus, and any other relevant class material. Students can also comment on specific material if they’re unsure. It has the same design as prototype 1.

### Class Material Page (Opened)
![Picture8](/milestone_2_pictures/class_material_open.png)
This page contains the pdf form of the class material, as well as a comment section for students who are unsure. It has the same design as prototype 1.

### Edit session 
![Picture9](/milestone_2_pictures/session_editor.png)
This page allows professors to create lecture questions and upload files needed. The design of this page is the same design as prototype 2.

### Class Stats
![Picture9]()
This page displays general class information to the professor. The type of information it presents can vary from the amount of time students spend on class work, ratings from rate my professor, most commented class material, etc. 

### Class details
![Picture9](/milestone_2_pictures/session_details.png)
This page contains a table of students’ answers and professors and export the file as attendance use or other use. There is also in class questions asked by students. The design of this page is a combination of both prototype 1 and 2.
