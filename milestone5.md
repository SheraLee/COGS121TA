# Milestone 5

## How target user would use your app in order to help them achieve relevant goals.

Our target users are professors teaching in larger classrooms.

Due to the large amount of students in the classroom, professors need a better way to control the class. Our app can increase interactions between professors and students during class and help professors get more timely feedback from students to improve the class experience without interrupting the lecture. 


1) In class feedbacks

  In our slides page, students can ask questions in class, the professor can adjust his pace based on those quetion and feedbacks. If the instructor do not address a specific problem in class, the TAs can also answer in the comment sections. This ensures that every students will be able to follow the pace of the professor   


2) Compare with the past classes

  Besides those short period feedbacks from students, the professor can also compare his class with past year classes to check if his class is in good progress.This can provide teh professor a big picture of how the class is going.

It looks more neat and use the screen space more efficiently. The profile picture and button also has been adjust to look better.

2) Data display improvment 

  New question segment sort data by category and dispaly them in better position of the page. The unsolved question is at the top, which ca catch more attention. Instructor's comments has bee moved down, scince it is probaly less important to the professor.
